# Jekylltheme
This is the theme I designed for my zeinsleiman.com website. Feel free to download and modify as you want.

Theme is built using:

* Bootstrap 4 Beta
* Google Fonts "Roboto", "RobotoSlab"
* FontAwesome

It supports Google Analytics, Disqus for comments and you can link accounts to your profile.

Note:
Disqus wont show if you run it locally. You will need to remove

```
{% if jekyll.environment == "production" %}
```

If you would like to contribute to the project feel free to add an issue and contribute.

I am fairly new to this, so if I am doing something wrong feel free to contact me.
